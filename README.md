# The Road to Reinforcement Learning

After studying the theory in reinforcement learning in several ways, and applying it in different occasions from MDPs to QL and DQNs, I decided to start over with a more formal education on the topic

In this repo, I will be documenting all the steps I am taking towards mastering reinforcement learning. Luckily, I came across a great book that will make this process more formalized and enjoyable. __[Deep Reinforcement Learning Hands-on](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/deep-reinforcement-learning/9781838826994/Text/Chapter_4.xhtml)__

Work that relate directly to that book can be found __[here](DRL/)__

Although I am going back to basics, I have some experience in utilizing RL for a variety of purposes and therefore I would love to collaborate on interesting projects that utilize RL, specially for robotics and autonomous vehicles.
